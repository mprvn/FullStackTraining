<h3>Google</h3>
<p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares but control 56 of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,"[9] and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil."[10][11] In 2004, Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.[12]</p>
